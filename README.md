# TODOS
I feel like Im done with the game, I might make some animations in the future so it feels more "alive". Maybe I will make some missing models for all  units that are already implemented.

I really enjoyed this project but I dont feel like writing another videogame anytime soon, however I'd like to implement multiplayer support and Im currently working on it.
